Solidity smart contracts security | beginner to expert

### Getting started

- `Rentrancy attacks`

  - This is an attack made by continuously calling back into the function
    before updating state

- `Acess control`

  - Improper access control can lead to unauthorized access and operations on your smart contract. Always implement strict access controls for sensitive functions.
  
- `Proper error handling`

  - Proper error handling ensures that your contract behaves as expected under all conditions and provides informative messages when something goes wrong.
  
- `Insecure Randomness`

  - Using on-chain data like block.timestamp for randomness is insecure because it can be manipulated by miners.
  
- `Timestamp dependence`

  - Using block timestamps for critical logic can be manipulated by miners to some extent.

- `Price bait attack`
  
  - The “price bait” attack is a sophisticated front-running attack where an attacker manipulates the price of an asset in a decentralized exchange (DEX) or other DeFi protocols to deceive users. This attack exploits the transparency of the blockchain and the time delay between transaction submission and execution.

### `Best Practices for Secure Smart Contract Development`

- Use Established Libraries: Leverage well-audited libraries like OpenZeppelin to avoid common pitfalls.

- Conduct Thorough Testing: Implement unit tests and integration tests using frameworks like Truffle or Hardhat. Consider edge cases and potential attack vectors.

- Code Reviews and Audits: Regular code reviews and third-party audits are essential to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Implement Upgradability Carefully: If your contract needs to be upgradeable, use proxy patterns and follow best practices to manage state and logic separation.

- Do not use block.timestamp to generate important random numbers or perform critical logic operations.
  
- Limit External Calls: Minimize the use of external calls and ensure they are necessary. Validate all inputs and handle unexpected responses securely.
